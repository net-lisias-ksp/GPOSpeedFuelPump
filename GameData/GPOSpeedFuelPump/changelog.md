1.24.1: First public release.

1.29.1: Added ability to selectively disable pumping or balancing of one or more resources on parts that have multiple kinds of resources in them, either from the options window or in the config files.

2.14.1: Fixed (hopefully) compatibility issue with Modular Fuels/Real Fuels, or other mods that modify which resources a tank contains after loading, and added a sanity check to prevent pumping of antifuel in impossible circumstances that apparently occasionally happen anyway.
